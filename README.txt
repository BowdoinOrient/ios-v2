Description: 
This app allows users to access The Bowdoin Orient, Bowdoin's student-run newspaper, and read the latest articles. The user can share articles on Twitter and Facebook. It runs on both iPhone and iPad. 

Features:
The app first brings the user to the Orient homepage, which displays a slideshow of recommended articles as well as articles from all of the different sections. The user can scroll down the homepage to access a certain section. To access a section from any article or landing page, the user can also horizontally swipe the label in the top right corner that initially says "Home" to reach the desired section. To load this section, the user must press the reload icon to the right. A new webpage will load that jumps the user to the desired section on the Orient website. An activity indicator will appear in the middle of the screen during the load process to let the user know that the webpage has been requested. 
If the user ever wants to return to the homepage, pressing the Bowdoin Orient logo in the top left corner will do the trick. The section scroll list will automatically jump back to display Home. 
To access a search button or post an article on Facebook or Twitter, the user can double tap on the screen. This will bring up a bottom menu that displays the necessary buttons. As long as the user is already signed in to Twitter or Facebook or has saved their account information in Settings, they can post the article directly to their social media account.
The user is still able to access website features, such as commenting, when using the app. 
Both the iPhone and iPad versions work in any orientation. 
This app gives the user access to all content and features on one screen, so all of the main features are present in the OrientViewController classes. The OrientSplashController sets up the splash that appears when the user first opens the app before being taken to the homepage.
